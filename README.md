# Blue Dot Project: A Data Driven "Controller"
Thi is a study into Locus Coeruleus Norepinephrine System and Security Motivation System rumination pathology pathway using computational methods. To this end, we are creating a Locus Coeruleus rumination system in which we call it as the **B**lue **D**ot (LC in greek means little blue dot) **P**roject (BDP).

## Three Data Driven Models:
We try to leverage neurosciecne behavior data related to LC-NE system to build a data driven model to fit and then manipulate the model component we have to give us a platform to operate on and play around with it (i.e. play around with the input and output and design the internal structure differently to see what would be the effects).

- First, we want to use **classical networks** (i.e feedforward fully connected neural networks, LSTM, ...) to fit the data, then try to correlate the concepts that these computation models have learned with concepts in neuroscience.
    - Maybe this can get us closer to the true process of information processing?

- Second, we want to use the the idea of building an **mechanistic model**:
    - We want more data, more neuroscience situations for this mechanistic model to fit to and demostrate its effects.
    - Very interpretable model as we control each "mechanistic" controller in seeing what might happen if we change something.
    - Can we add more RL flavor into the models?

- Third, we want to create a **fancy gadget model** for our classical network models to use. Instead of modifying the models directly, maybe we can take an approach that the Neural Turing Machine (NTM) did and try to create a gadget (in NTM it represents memory for read and write) and for us the gadget can be think of as teh LC-NE system.
    - This gadget it incorporates ideas in LC-NE and also ideas in cortex.
    - It need to be differentiable so everything can be back propoagted and we can see if the network can learn to use this controller (LC-NE system) to achieve the effect we see in the samples.

At last, we can use this fitteed model to prompt them under certain `experimental` conditions and see hwo they would react to as compares to rea behavior data from animals or human (i.e. the two lick test for rodent).

## Preliminary Results:
We provide an [sample notebook](https://github.com/KevinBian107/Blue-Dot-Project/blob/main/simulate.ipynb) for demostration purposes. Now  we have a sand-box that has been setup  to implement all kinds of cool neuroscience ideas that we can do.

## Reference Literatures
Data Source:
- The [openneuro](https://openneuro.org/) is a very good source of data, we are specifically using this ["Locus coeruleus activity strengthens prioritized memories under arousal"](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002011/versions/1.0.0) dataset for now.
- Please do not push the data to GitHub, rather all work on it locally.
